# Idealized use-cases:
# Scenario A) New major release X.0.0
#   Premise:
#     There is a main branch a version X.0-SNAPSHOT, with a japimp reference version of (X-1).Y.Z
#   Release flow:
#     - update the main to (X+1).0-SNAPSHOT, but keep the reference version intact since X.0.0 is not released (yet)
#     - create X.0-SNAPSHOT branch, but keep the reference version intact since X.0.0 is not released (yet)
#     - release X.0.0
#     - update the japicmp reference version of both main and X.0-SNAPSHOT to X.0.0
#     - enable stronger compatibility constraints for X.0-SNAPSHOT to ensure compatibility for PublicEvolving
# Scenario A) New minor release X.Y.0
#   Premise:
#     There is a main branch with a version X.Y-SNAPSHOT, with a japicmp reference version of X.(Y-1).0 .
#   Release flow:
#     - update the main branch to X.(Y+1)-SNAPSHOT, but keep the reference version intact since X.Y.0 is not released (yet)
#     - create X.Y-SNAPSHOT branch, but keep the reference version intact since X.Y.0 is not released (yet)
#     - release X.Y.0
#     - update the japicmp reference version of both main and X.Y-SNAPSHOT to X.Y.0
#     - enable stronger compatibility constraints for X.Y-SNAPSHOT to ensure compatibility for PublicEvolving
# Scenario C) New patch release X.Y.Z
#   Premise:
#     There is a snapshot branch with a version X.Y-SNAPSHOT, with a japicmp reference version of X.Y.(Z-1)
#   Release flow:
#     - release X.Y.Z
#     - update the japicmp reference version of X.Y-SNAPSHOT to X.Y.Z
