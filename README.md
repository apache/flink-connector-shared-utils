This is a collection of release utils for [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) connectors.

# Integration

The scripts assume that they are integrated into a connector repo as a submodule into the connector repo
under `tools/releasing/shared`.

# Usage

Some scripts rely on environment variables to be set.  
These are checked at the start of each script.  
Any instance of `${some_variable}` in this document refers to an environment variable that is used by the respective
script.

## check_environment.sh

Runs some pre-release checks for the current environment, for example that all required programs are available.  
This should be run once at the start of the release process.

## publish_snapshot_branch.sh

Creates (and pushes!) a new snapshot branch for the current commit.  
The branch name is automatically determined from the version in the pom.  
This script should be called when work on a new major/minor version of the connector has started.

## update_branch_version.sh

Updates the version in the poms of the current branch to `${NEW_VERSION}`.

## stage_source_release.sh

Creates a source release from the current branch and pushes it via `svn`
to [dist.apache.org](https://dist.apache.org/repops/dist/dev/flink).  
The version is automatically determined from the version in the pom.  
The created `svn` directory will contain a `-rc${RC_NUM}` suffix.

## stage_jars.sh

Creates the jars from the current branch and deploys them to [repository.apache.org](https://repository.apache.org).  
The version will be suffixed with `-${FLINK_MINOR_VERSION}` to indicate the supported Flink version.  
If a particular version of a connector supports multiple Flink versions then this script should be called multiple
times.

## publish_git_tag.sh

Creates a release tag for the current branch and pushes it to GitHub.
The tag will be suffixed with `-rc${RC_NUM}`, if `${RC_NUM}` was set.  
This script should only be used _after_ the `-SNAPSHOT` version suffix was removd via `update_branch_version.sh`.

## update_japicmp_configuration.sh

Sets the japicmp reference version in the pom of the current branch to `${NEW_VERSION}`, enables compatibility checks
for `@PublicEvolving` when used on snapshot branches an clears the list of exclusions.  
This should be called after a release on the associated snapshot branch. If it was a minor release it should
additionally be called on the `main` branch.

# Common workflow

1. run `publish_snapshot_branch.sh`
2. do some development work on the created snapshot branch
3. checkout a specific commit to create a release from
4. run `check_environment.sh`
5. run `update_branch_version.sh`
6. run `stage_source_release.sh`
7. run `stage_jars.sh` (once for each supported Flink version)
8. run `publish_git_tag.sh` (with `RC_NUM`)
9. vote on release
10. finalize release or cancel and go back to step 2
11. run `publish_git_tag.sh` (without `RC_NUM`)
12. run `update_japicmp_configuration.sh` (on snapshot branch, and maybe `main`)
