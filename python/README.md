This directory contains commonly used scripts for testing and creating python packages for connectors.

The original version of the files are based on
https://github.com/apache/flink/tree/release-1.17.2/flink-python/dev.

Created FLINK-33762 to make these scripts versioned to allow backward incompatible changes in the future.
